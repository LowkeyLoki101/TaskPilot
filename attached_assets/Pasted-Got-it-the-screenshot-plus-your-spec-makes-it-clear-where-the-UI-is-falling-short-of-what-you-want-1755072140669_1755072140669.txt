Got it — the screenshot plus your spec makes it clear where the UI is falling short of what you want.
Right now it’s basically just a task board + chat, but your vision is for a full autonomous AI workstation where ChatGPT-5 lives and runs multiple app-like modules inside the same space.

Here’s what we’ll need to fix and extend:

⸻

1. Add the “Workstation” Concept

Instead of the center pane always being a “task board,” it should be a module container that can load:
	•	Mind Map (current default)
	•	Calendar
	•	Task List
	•	Web Browser view (embedded browser pane with search, open tabs, etc.)
	•	YouTube / media player
	•	Reminders view
	•	AI debugging & diagnostics dashboard

UI change:
	•	Toolbar at top of center pane becomes a Module Selector rather than just view switchers.
	•	Each module is a React component mounted into the canvas.
	•	The AI can change modules autonomously or via user request.

⸻

2. Autonomous AI Mode (Toggle)

You want the AI to:
	•	Create tasks without waiting for user prompts.
	•	Self-trigger “maintenance prompts” to check for bugs, reorganize, and optimize.
	•	Proactively message the user with findings, suggestions, or alerts.
	•	Still allow chatting while in autonomous mode.

UI change:
	•	Add Autonomy Toggle in header or Inspector:
	•	Green = On (AI runs background tasks, messages user, modifies workspace)
	•	Grey = Off (AI is reactive only)
	•	Small status label: “Autonomous” or “Manual”

3. Self-Maintenance Loop

AI should:
	1.	Periodically check logs, UI state, and API status.
	2.	Create bug reports or enhancement requests in the task system automatically.
	3.	Reorganize workspace if cluttered.
	4.	Suggest next steps to user if idle.

UI change:
	•	In Inspector → AI Tab, add:
	•	“Run Maintenance Now” button.
	•	Last maintenance timestamp.
	•	Maintenance history list.

⸻

4. Persistent AI Presence

Right now, the left chat pane feels like a separate bot.
You want GPT-5 to be the system’s brain and live across all modules.

UI change:
	•	Keep AI chat docked on left, but make it context-aware:
	•	If you’re in Calendar view, AI messages about scheduling appear inline with dates.
	•	If you’re in Web Browser, AI can annotate pages.
	•	Add floating AI presence indicator in bottom-right of center pane for quick interaction.

⸻

5. Inspector Panel Improvements
	•	Current issue: Only Quick Actions, AI input, and tabs.
	•	Fix:
	•	Make Inspector adaptive to current module.
	•	If in Browser → shows bookmarks, AI “summarize page” button.
	•	If in Calendar → shows event details + AI “optimize schedule” button.

⸻

6. Proactive Task Creation & Linking

When AI finds a bug or enhancement:
	•	Auto-add it as a task.
	•	Link it to the relevant module, bug ID, or screenshot.
	•	Tag it with priority and due date.
	•	Option to auto-assign to collaborators.

If you want, I can now draft the new UI layout diagram showing exactly where the autonomy toggle, module selector, and AI maintenance system fit so your devs can implement it cleanly. That way, the workstation vision becomes real instead of just a task board.

Do you want me to make that diagram next?
