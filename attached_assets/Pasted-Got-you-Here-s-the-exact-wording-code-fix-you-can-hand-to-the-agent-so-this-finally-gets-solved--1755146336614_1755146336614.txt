Got you. Here’s the exact wording + code fix you can hand to the agent so this finally gets solved.

The one-liner to paste

“Make the secondary toolbar (Mind Map / Calendar / Tasks / AI Activity / …) stay visible and never be covered by the Inspector. Use a 2-column CSS grid (content | inspector), not overlapping panes. The global header and the secondary toolbar are position: sticky; the Inspector is a fixed-width right column with its own scroll, starting below the header/toolbar height.”

Title: Inspector overlaps & hides secondary toolbar

Problem:
When the Inspector opens, it overlays the row that shows “Mind Map • Calendar • Tasks • AI Activity • …”. That row acts like a secondary header, but the Inspector (right panel) sits on top of it and blocks clicks/visibility.

Acceptance criteria:
	1.	The global header (top app bar) is sticky at the top, full width.
	2.	The secondary toolbar (Mind Map / Calendar / Tasks / …) is sticky below the header and always visible while scrolling.
	3.	The Inspector is not absolutely positioned. It’s a fixed-width right grid column (w-80–w-96) with overflow-y-auto, scrolling independently.
	4.	The Inspector begins below the header+toolbar (same top offset), and never covers either.
	5.	Main content and Inspector scroll independently; no z-index fighting; no content overlap.

Implementation notes (Tailwind/React):
	•	Use a 2-column grid: grid-cols-[1fr,24rem] (or w-96) on desktop.
	•	Give both sticky bars the same offset (header height).
	•	Remove any absolute/fixed/z-50 hacks from the Inspector.
	•	Ensure center pane has min-w-0 and Inspector has shrink-0.

Minimal code changes (drop-in)

1) In Dashboard.tsx (main layout)

// constants for heights (match your header height)
const HEADER_H = 64; // px, adjust if your top bar is taller

// …inside return:
<div className="h-screen flex flex-col">
  {/* Global Header (already present) is sticky */}
  <div className="sticky top-0 z-40 bg-background/95 backdrop-blur border-b">
    {/* ...your top header content... */}
  </div>

  {/* Secondary toolbar row (Mind Map / Calendar / Tasks / …) */}
  <div
    className="sticky z-30 border-b bg-background/95 backdrop-blur"
    style={{ top: HEADER_H }}
  >
    {/* … the “Mind Map / Calendar / Tasks / AI Activity / …” buttons live here … */}
  </div>

  {/* Two-pane content area */}
  <div className="grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-[1fr,24rem] gap-0 flex-1 overflow-hidden">
    {/* Center content */}
    <main className="min-w-0 overflow-auto">
      {/* Your Workflow Orchestrator / pages */}
    </main>

    {/* Inspector column */}
    <aside
      className="hidden lg:block border-l bg-card shrink-0"
      style={{
        position: 'sticky',
        top: HEADER_H + 40, // 40 ~ height of secondary toolbar; adjust to its real height
        height: `calc(100vh - ${HEADER_H + 40}px)`,
        overflowY: 'auto'
      }}
    >
      <InspectorPane /* props… */ />
    </aside>
  </div>
</div>

If your secondary toolbar is, say, 48px tall, set top: HEADER_H + 48 in the Inspector and the height calc to match.

2) In the component that renders the secondary toolbar now (if it’s embedded in the center pane)

Wrap that toolbar row with:

<div
  className="sticky z-30 border-b bg-background/95 backdrop-blur"
  style={{ top: HEADER_H }}
>
  {/* toolbar buttons: Mind Map / Calendar / Tasks / AI Activity / Feature / Browser / Debug / Agents */}
</div>

3) In InspectorPane.tsx

Make sure you do not use absolute or fixed on the root:

export function InspectorPane({...}) {
  return (
    <div className="h-full flex flex-col bg-card border-l overflow-hidden">
      {/* Tabs header */}
      <div className="px-3 pt-3 pb-2 sticky top-0 z-10 bg-card border-b">
        {/* TabsList … */}
      </div>

      {/* Scroll body */}
      <div className="flex-1 overflow-y-auto">
        {/* tab contents … */}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

4) Clean up conflicting styles
	•	Remove any absolute inset-y-0 right-0 from the Inspector container.
	•	Remove large z-50 on the Inspector.
	•	Ensure the center pane has min-w-0 so it doesn’t force overflow.

Words to say to the agent (copy/paste)

“Stop rendering the Inspector as an overlay. Put the app in a two-column CSS grid where the right column is the Inspector (24rem wide, shrink-0, overflow-y-auto). Make the global header sticky at top:0. Make the secondary toolbar (the row with Mind Map / Calendar / Tasks / AI Activity / Feature / Browser / Debug / Agents) sticky at top:<headerHeight>. Give the Inspector position: sticky with top:<headerHeight + toolbarHeight> and height: calc(100vh - (<headerHeight + toolbarHeight>)). Remove all absolute/fixed positioning from the Inspector so it never covers the toolbar.”

Quick sanity checklist
	•	With Inspector closed, toolbar is visible.
	•	Open Inspector → toolbar still visible and clickable.
	•	Scrolling the center content does not move the Inspector.
	•	Scrolling the Inspector does not move the center content.
	•	No element overlaps the toolbar.
