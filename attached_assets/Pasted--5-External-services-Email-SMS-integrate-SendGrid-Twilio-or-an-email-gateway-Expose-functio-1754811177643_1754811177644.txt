	5.	External services
	•	Email/SMS: integrate SendGrid, Twilio or an email gateway.  Expose functions like sendEmail(to, subject, body) and sendSMS(number, message) to the assistant.
	•	Calendar: integrate Google Calendar via OAuth.  Provide a function like createCalendarEvent with parameters (title, startDate, endDate, attendees).  The assistant can schedule tasks when due dates are assigned.
	•	Search the web: integrate with Google Custom Search, Bing API or SerpAPI.  Provide a searchWeb function that returns top results.  Use the results to find YouTube videos, articles or templates.

Deployment on Replit
	1.	Create a new Replit project and choose a Node.js + React template (or manually set up a monorepo).
	2.	Add the necessary environment variables under Secrets:
	•	OPENAI_API_KEY – your OpenAI API key.
	•	SENDGRID_API_KEY, TWILIO_SID, etc. – credentials for external services.
	•	NEO4J_URI, NEO4J_USER, NEO4J_PASSWORD – if using Neo4j.
	3.	In the backend directory (/server), run npm install to install dependencies.  In the frontend directory (/client), run npm install to install React dependencies.  Use concurrently or two separate Replit run commands to start both servers.
	4.	Configure the Replit .replit file to run both the backend and frontend using a script like npm run dev, which uses concurrently to run the backend and a React dev server.

Additional Considerations
	•	Accessibility: ensure keyboard navigation and screen‑reader compatibility.  Provide voice feedback or read‑aloud for visually impaired users.
	•	Data privacy: encrypt stored tasks, especially attachments.  Do not log sensitive information.  Provide a privacy policy.
	•	Extensibility: design the function schema so new tools (e.g., generatePDF, createQRCode) can be added without rewriting the assistant.
	•	Testing: implement unit tests for functions and end‑to‑end tests for the conversational flow.  Use Replit’s testing tools or Jest/Cypress.
	•	Open source licensing: include MIT or similar license if you plan to share the code publicly.

Conclusion

This design document provides the architecture, key components, and implementation details required to deliver a high‑level version of the voice‑enabled interactive task manager on Replit.  By combining an interactive mind map, AI‑generated tasks, multi‑view interfaces, versioning, and function calling, the tool can serve as a powerful personal assistant that not only plans but also executes tasks on behalf of the user.
