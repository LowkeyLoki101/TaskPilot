# Route Trace Analysis
Generated: August 13, 2025

## Backend Route Map

### Health & System Routes
- `GET /api/health` ✅ Working - Returns system health status
- `POST /api/comprehensive-diagnostic` ✅ Working - Returns detailed system analysis

### Activity & Logging Routes  
- `GET /api/activity` ⚠️ **ISSUE** - Returns empty arrays, not showing real activities
- Backend logs activities but frontend doesn't receive them

### AI & Autonomous Routes
- `POST /api/autonomous-actions` ✅ Exists - Generates AI actions
- Backend shows: "Generated X autonomous actions" but UI doesn't display them

### Project & Chat Routes
- `GET /api/projects/default-project/chat` ✅ Working - Chat messages
- `POST /api/projects/:projectId/chat` ✅ Working - Send messages

### Missing/Problematic Routes
- Activity logging not syncing to frontend
- Autonomous actions not visible in UI
- Button actions may not have proper endpoints

## Critical Fixes Needed

### 1. Activity Logger Sync Issue
**Problem**: Backend `activityLogger.log()` not reaching frontend `/api/activity`
**Root Cause**: Possible disconnect between activity logger storage and API endpoint
**Fix**: Ensure activity logger writes to same data source that `/api/activity` reads from

### 2. Real-time Updates
**Problem**: Activities happen but UI doesn't update until manual refresh
**Solution**: Fix React Query cache updates and WebSocket notifications

### 3. Button Action Feedback
**Problem**: User actions don't show immediate visual feedback
**Solution**: Add loading states and success indicators to all interactive elements

## Testing Plan
1. Trace each button click through backend logs
2. Verify activity logger writes are being read by API
3. Test autonomous system visibility
4. Confirm all critical user paths work end-to-end
