# System Diagnostics Report
Generated: August 13, 2025

## Current Issues Identified

### 1. Frontend-Backend Activity Disconnection
**Problem**: AI autonomous actions are running on backend but not displaying in frontend UI
**Evidence**: 
- Console shows maintenance cycles: "Running autonomous maintenance check..." at regular intervals
- Frontend activity log remains empty despite backend activity
- User reports buttons feel "disconnected from actual actions"

### 2. Route Tracing Analysis

#### Backend Routes Status
- ✅ `/api/health` - Working (200 responses every ~47s)
- ✅ `/api/activity` - Responding (304 cached, but data may be empty)
- ✅ `/api/comprehensive-diagnostic` - Working (showed 92/100 score)
- ✅ `/api/autonomous-actions` - Route exists
- ❓ `/api/maintenance` - Not being called from frontend

#### Frontend Activity Display Issues
- Activity log queries return empty arrays `[]`
- React Query cache not being updated with real activity data
- Autonomous maintenance runs but doesn't appear in AI tab

### 3. Button Action Disconnections
**Symptoms**:
- User clicks buttons but no visible feedback
- Actions may execute but UI doesn't reflect changes
- Feeling of disconnected interface

## Diagnostic Actions Required
1. Fix activity logging sync between backend and frontend
2. Ensure all button actions have proper feedback
3. Connect autonomous system output to visible UI updates
4. Test all critical user interaction paths

## Next Steps
- [ ] Fix activity logger integration
- [ ] Add real-time activity display
- [ ] Test button responsiveness
- [ ] Verify autonomous system visibility
