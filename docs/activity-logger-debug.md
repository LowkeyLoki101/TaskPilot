# Activity Logger Debug Analysis
Generated: August 13, 2025 - 18:55

## Issue Identified
**Problem**: Frontend `/api/activity` returns `[]` while backend shows autonomous maintenance running
**Root Cause**: Need to trace the `/api/activity` route implementation

## Evidence
1. ✅ ActivityLogger class exists with `getActivities()` method
2. ✅ Console logs show: "Running autonomous maintenance check..."
3. ❌ API endpoint returns empty array: `curl /api/activity` → `[]`
4. ✅ ActivityLogger imported in routes.ts line 11
5. ✅ Route exists at line 220: `app.get("/api/activity", ...)`

## Investigation Steps
1. [IN PROGRESS] Check route implementation at line 220
2. [PENDING] Verify activityLogger is being used in the route  
3. [PENDING] Test if activities are being logged to the right instance
4. [PENDING] Fix disconnect between logger and API response

## Expected Fix
The `/api/activity` route should call `activityLogger.getActivities()` but may be:
- Using wrong logger instance
- Not calling the logger at all  
- Returning cached empty responses

## Next Actions
- Check route implementation
- Fix the disconnect
- Test with real activity data
- Update UI to show activities
